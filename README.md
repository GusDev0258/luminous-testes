# 🌟 Luminous Backend - Energy Waste Monitoring App

Welcome to Luminous Backend, the backend part of the energy waste monitoring app project. This backend was created using Java Spring Boot with Maven, and it integrates JPA for database management with PostgreSQL. Additionally, it employs JWT Token and Spring Security for enhanced authentication and authorization.

## Project Overview 📊

Luminous Backend serves as the backbone for the Luminous UI front-end application. It provides the necessary APIs and functionality to support the monitoring and management of energy usage efficiently.
